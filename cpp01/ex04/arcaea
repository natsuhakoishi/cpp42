—And after, they slept.

A million stories come to an end, and a million stories go on, retold. Yet there are "tales" in between
that go unwritten and thus unheard. They pass on, unspoken.

They pass into memory.
Memory...

For better or worse, memory will not discriminate. A moment in the mind of one, or a moment shared
by many, will take shape unspoiled. However innocuous, however tragic, however wonderful, a
memory will capture it, though it may never be put to record.

And when unrecorded, what has passed into memory will inevitably fade into ether.

You might think that something forgotten can't have any importance. Perhaps that's true. Why
remember a fall? Why remember sorrow? Why remember some sweet taste?

And certainly, the answers to those questions do matter...

...but time does not slow while they're being asked.

As they're asked, as they are considered, an archive ceaselessly grows...

Some where and when...

The Archive of Memory begins to spool thread:

threads of fate, tugging along two lives.

Shining, colorless—the unspoiled ideal:

threads of light and conflict.
